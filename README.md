# mentorship
The [author](mailto:yadevinit@gmail.com) initiated this while being an Alumni Mentor for undergraduate students with [IIT (BHU) Varanasi, India](https://saic.iitbhu.ac.in/) in 2022.

-  Survival analysis with cancer data: [Surviving pancreatic cancer](https://github.com/Anchaliya75/Pancreatic-Cancer-Research-Paper-Implementation#pancreatic-cancer) has a Student Mentee's contribution. That uses a [dataset](./mmc1tabS1a-202204281228.csv) generated by this author by developing [`surviveMetastasis`](./surviveMetastasis-2022Apr28-1229.ipynb), a Jupyter Notebook with `R` code that cleaned data (and made it more usable) from the [Computational Modeling of Pancreatic Cancer Reveals Kinetics of Metastasis Suggesting Optimum Treatment Strategies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.11.060) as shown in [session output of data cleaning and preliminary exploratory analysis](./surviveMetastasis-2022Apr28-1230.pdf). (The dataset is accessibly provided here in the spirit of mentorship while duly acknowledging the source.)

-  Optimization with COVID-19 data: TBD.
