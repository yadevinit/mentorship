# mentorship
The [author](mailto:yadevinit@gmail.com) initiated this while being an Alumni Mentor for undergraduate students with [IIT (BHU) Varanasi, India](https://saic.iitbhu.ac.in/) in 2022.

-  Survival analysis with cancer data: [Surviving pancreatic cancer](https://github.com/Anchaliya75/Pancreatic-Cancer-Research-Paper-Implementation#pancreatic-cancer) has a Student Mentee's contribution. That uses a [dataset](./mmc1tabS1a-202204281228.csv) generated by this author by developing [`surviveMetastasis`](./surviveMetastasis-2022Apr28-1229.ipynb), a Jupyter Notebook with `R` code that cleaned data (and made it more usable) from the [Computational Modeling of Pancreatic Cancer Reveals Kinetics of Metastasis Suggesting Optimum Treatment Strategies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.11.060) as shown in [session output of data cleaning and preliminary exploratory analysis](./surviveMetastasis-2022Apr28-1230.pdf). (The dataset is accessibly provided here in the spirit of mentorship while duly acknowledging the source.)

-  Optimization with COVID-19 data: TBD contribution from another Student Mentee. [Optimal weights](./op2lp.sol.list.df.csv) ranging from `0` to `1` are what are allocated by various solvers (column wise in the table); for each row, the weight multiplied by total vaccines produced is what's optimal for allocating to the corresponding USA county (whose unique 5-digit FIPS Code is in 1st column). That was generated as shown in [Session output for optimization using `R`](./optVacciNation-2022May22-1303.pdf) by running [Jupyter Notebook for optimization using `R` kernel](./optVacciNation.ipynb) using [dataset](./myData.tVaccMi.csv), which in turn was got by running `optVaccine.ipynb` (with URLs for data sources) as shown in session output `optVaccine-2022May16-1036.pdf`.  Along with Objective to be minimized, it also constrained each county's weight to be `<= 0.1`.  Towards the end of the session, you can see similarities and differences in outputs from the various solvers.  In the session, you can also see the optimization problem initially specified via functions and later specified in simpler-to-solve linear-programming algebraic form.  There is a "TBD" note at the end listing what could be done further.  Binary solver output `op2lp.sol0.1.rds` (non text) has the output solutions from the solvers; if you wish to analyze it programmatically, read it into an `R` cell:

    >    `myrds <- readRDS(file="op2lp.sol0.1.rds")`
